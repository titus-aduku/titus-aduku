### üéØ My Mission

> "As a nurse in Ghana, my own journey through the healthcare system laid bare the critical gaps I saw daily with my patients: the fractured data pathways between rural clinics and urban hospitals, a lack of access to specialist care, and the supply chain failures that put essential treatments out of reach. This experience, as both provider and patient, cemented my mission. I am becoming a Healthcare AI Systems Developer to build the data-driven bridges that close these gaps‚Äîengineering robust, intelligent systems that ensure every patient's information travels seamlessly with them, empowering clinicians with the right insights at the right time for timely, equitable, and truly personalized care."

### üó∫Ô∏è My Portfolio Roadmap

This repository serves as my public commitment and a living document of my journey. Below is the roadmap of my three core capstone projects.

*(Key: ‚è≥ Planned | üöß In Progress | ‚úÖ Completed)*

### Phase 1: The Health Systems Efficiency Engine (Status: ‚è≥ Planned)
*   **Project:** Predictive Engine for Chronic Disease Medication Demand.
*   **Goal:** To build a production-ready operational tool that de-risks the pharmaceutical supply chain and improves patient adherence using public health data.

### Phase 2: The Intelligent Referral Gateway (Status: ‚è≥ Planned)
*   **Project:** Automated Structuring of GP Referral Letters for Specialist Triage.
*   **Goal:** To build a workflow optimization tool that reduces specialist cognitive load and cuts patient triage time using Natural Language Processing.

### Phase 3: The Causal Analysis & Simulation Framework (Status: ‚è≥ Planned)
*   **Project:** Evaluating and Simulating a Clinical Diagnostic Pathway for Venous Insufficiency.
*   **Goal:** To build a 'what-if' engine for health policy, allowing leaders to test the impact of interventions on equity and outcomes in silico.
